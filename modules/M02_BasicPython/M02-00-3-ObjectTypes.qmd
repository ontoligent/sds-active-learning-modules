title: Python Object Types
---

Python is organized into a hierarchy of object types. Sometimes, these are just call **types**.

Objects are the basic unit out of which the language is constructed.

We'll learn about objects later -- what they are and how to create your own -- but for now just understand that they have two main things associated with them:

* First, they can contain **data**.
* Second, they can have **behaviors**, frequently in relation to the data they contain.

Data types and data structures are kinds of objects.
