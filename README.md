President and Provost's Fund for Institutionally Related Research: Data Science Active Learning Lab.

# Project Description

Active learning approaches have not been widely applied and tested in data science courses despite significant research supporting their benefits and its successful adoption in computer science. One study notes a 33% increase in pass rates for computer science courses employing active learning as compared to traditional lecture classes. The Academy for Teaching Excellence has thousands of resources to aid in the teaching of computer science content with hundreds of assignments, but essentially no empirically tested resources for data science. 

A key component of the active learning approach is the design, development, and testing of authentic and transparent assessments. Authentic assignments asks students to either inhabit a role seen in the discipline or do the work of the discipline. Transparent assignments explicity state their purpose, tasks, and criteria. Research has shown that transparent assignments improve a wide range of student success metrics, including a sense of belonging which can be a significant factor in the retention of underrepresented student populations, particularly in STEM.

A major obstacle to creating authentic and transparent active learning assessments is the time and effort required to develop, implement, and test them. **The Data Science Active Learning Lab will provide the resources and structure necessary for collaborative course development.** The Lab will enable faculty and graduate students to work together to develop and empirically test active learning activities in their data science courses. This will result in the identification and validation of best practices along with practical tools that can be shared broadly and openly across the field of Data Science.

The Lab will reduce the time burden on faculty to create effective assessments. More important, it will establish a trusted research framework and tools that have been empirically tested for effectiveness. Such a resource is currently unavailable in data science pedagogy. We also have a unique opportunity, given the newness of the field, to develop cultural norms around teaching that are known to benefit underrepresented groups and first-generation students. This funding will go a long way to advance that effort by establishing a pedological research lab specifically focused on student success in a historically fast-growing field.

# Project Goals

In pursuit of the mission to provide resources to enable faculty to create effective active learning assessments for data science, the project has the following goals.

-   Be a preeminent **resource** for empirically tested best practices in data science education.

-   Establish a **testing and validation framework** for data science oriented active learning tools.

-   Create and socialize **teaching norms** in data science that are proven to benefit underrepresented groups and first-generation students.

-   Develop and test active learning assessments (labs) specifically for courses in the proposed **data science undergraduate major**. (Projected courses include the Foundation of Data Science, Foundations of Machine Learning, Computation Probability, Data Science Ethics and Policy, and Data Science Systems.)

-   **Disseminate open instructional content** in accordance with the School of Data Science open access policy and UVA's Open Scholarship agreement.

The goal of the summer is for each faculty member to create three
implementable active learning sessions that can be embedded into classes in the next academic year. These active learning sessions should include the following materials covering a roughly two-week period.

I.  Summary of the learning objectives for the session.

II. Pre-reading and/or video material.

III. Two Active learning lecture sessions and associated material

IV. Assessments -- assignments, reflections, quizzes, group work etc.

V.  Evaluation rubrics for learning outcomes.

VI. Review process to encourage retention.
