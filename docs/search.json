    "text": "Preface\nThis site contains three active learning modules for an introductory undergraduate course on programming for data science.\nThese modules have been developed as part of the Data Science Active Learning Lab (DSALL) project, sponsored by the President and Provost’s Fund for Institutionally Related Research at UVA. The project is headed by Professor Brian Wright, in collaboration with Professor Pete Alonzi, of the School of Data Science at UVA.\n\n\nMotivation and Design\nDSALL is motivated by the observation that active learning approaches (AL) have not been widely applied and tested in data science courses, even though a body of significant research demonstrates the benefits of AL and many instructors of computer science have adopted AL successfully.\nA key element of AL is the design, development, and testing of authentic and transparent assessments.\nAuthentic assignments ask students to either inhabit a role seen in the discipline or do the work of the discipline.\nTransparent assignments explicity state their purpose, tasks, and criteria. Research has shown that transparent assignments improve a wide range of student success metrics, including a sense of belonging which can be a significant factor in the retention of underrepresented student populations, particularly in STEM.\nA major obstacle to creating authentic and transparent active learning assessments is the time and effort required to develop, implement, and test them. DSALL will provide the resources and structure necessary for collaborative course development. The Lab will enable faculty and graduate students to work together to develop and empirically test active learning activities in their data science courses. This will result in the identification and validation of best practices along with practical tools that can be shared broadly and openly across the field of Data Science.\nThe Lab will reduce the time burden on faculty to create effective assessments. More important, it will establish a trusted research framework and tools that have been empirically tested for effectiveness. Such a resource is currently unavailable in data science pedagogy. We also have a unique opportunity, given the newness of the field, to develop cultural norms around teaching that are known to benefit underrepresented groups and first-generation students. This funding will go a long way to advance that effort by establishing a pedological research lab specifically focused on student success in a historically fast-growing field.\n\n\nProject Goals\nIn pursuit of the mission to provide resources to enable faculty to create effective active learning assessments for data science, the project has the following goals.\n\nBe a preeminent resource for empirically tested best practices in data science education.\nEstablish a testing and validation framework for data science oriented active learning tools.\nCreate and socialize teaching norms in data science that are proven to benefit underrepresented groups and first-generation students.\nDevelop and test active learning assessments (labs) specifically for courses in the proposed data science undergraduate major. (Projected courses include the Foundation of Data Science, Foundations of Machine Learning, Computation Probability, Data Science Ethics and Policy, and Data Science Systems.)\nDisseminate open instructional content in accordance with the School of Data Science open access policy and UVA’s Open Scholarship agreement."

    "section": "Materials",
    "text": "Materials\n\nLearning Goals\nLearning goals should be the overarching goals of the class to which learning objectives could then align.\nExamples of Learning Goals for a Machine Learning Class might be:\n\nBe able to describe and execute the necessary steps to prepare data for machine learning models.\nDemonstrate understanding of the mathematical and computation machine requirements for several machine learning approaches and when they should be used.\nDemonstrate understanding of effective evaluation methods given different machine learning approaches.\n\n\n\nI. Learning Objectives.\nLearning Session: Data Preparation 1\nLearning Objectives:\n1.1a) Describe the reasons for and effectively demonstrate partitioning a dataset into train, test and tune.\n2.1a) Effectively describe and demonstrate why it is necessary to one-hot encode factor and standardize continuous variables specific to various machine learning models.\n3.1a) Execute and effectively describe dealing with missing data\n\n\nII. Pre-Reading and/or Video Material\nThis should reference specific sections in books known to be of high quality related to the content. I have a tendency to lean more heavily on books that include “theory” explanations aside from simple how-to text given that much of the how-to will be provided in the class.\nVideos can be very simple explaining the topics through presentation materials or code at a high level. I would work to limit the length of videos to 10 minutes or less and if several topics are covered break them into individual video segments. As a technic to consider, I often build a “stop and think” question in the video that I then discuss at the beginning of class to encourage students to watch and engage with the content. I also usually place these videos on YouTube as unlisted, but this does still allow you to track the watch time.\n\n\nIII. Active Learning Sessions\nThe definition of active learning is fairly broad, but in it’s simplest form it suggests that students should not be passive in their learning. This doesn’t eliminate classical lecturing methods but augments them to include directed moments when students are either engaging with each other or with the professor in more robust way than a traditional Q and A session. An example that Pete and I use a lot is “think, pair, share”. This includes use asking a question, having the students think on the answer alone, then discussing with a partner and then finally sharing with the class as a team. A good book on methods on Teaching Methods provided by CTE is Teaching at its Best by Linda B. Nelson, I’ve got a copy and can purchased more if needed (also please feel free to share other references).\nAs a reference I found this quote from a 2021 paper focused on developing a framework for active learning helpful: “To clarify, we synthesized a working definition of active learning that operates within an elaborative framework, which we call the construction-of-understanding ecosystem. A cornerstone of this framework is that undergraduate learners should be active agents during instruction and that the social construction of meaning plays an important role for many learners, above and beyond their individual cognitive construction of knowledge.”\nThe article is available here: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1529100620973974\n\n\nIV. Assessments\nAssessments can be the hardest and potentially the most time-consuming portion of course materials. The traditional path in most Data Science oriented classes is an assessment that focuses on implementing a method in code. I would encourage you to continue this practice but also consider adding written or verbal approaches to evaluating learning. This might include prompts in the coding assessments that require further written explanations or reflections on what was the most challenging/enjoyable portion of the assignment or what areas the students believe they need more practice. This information can then be used in a follow-up session that highlights the areas that a majority of students saw as needing more coverage. It is also important to create clear expectations on how the assessment will be evaluated and what the expectations are for the assessment. Below is an example assessment Pete developed for the DS 1001, though not a coding-based assessment the general structure is still relevant.\n\n\nV. Evaluation rubrics for learning outcomes\nThis step can likely be included in the development of assessments but having it as a standalone emphasizes the need for thoughtful design.\nThe goal here should be evaluation measures tailored to the assessments but also universal enough to be used in a standard lecture format.\nMeaning that the rubrics will be included as part of the experimental design to assess the variances in learning that occurs in an active learning environment when compared to a lecture format.\nIn the above example the quality of answers to the final question, “How do the answers to the questions make you feel as it relates to the presence of data driven technologies in our everyday lives?”, could be a focus on the evaluation rubric as it relates to the specific learning outcome around “understanding the growing influence of data on society”.\n\n\nVI. Review process to encourage retention – The idea here is to\nnot compartmentalize the learning objectives but blend them together from week to week to help reinforce the topics throughout the semesters.\nOne method example is to have quizzes that include questions from all weeks in the class not just the current topic. I think for this use case, simple direct sessions that are short in nature, 10-15 minutes, that review topics from the session makes more sense.\nExamples might include a guided back and forth on the key topics from the previous week or a team assignment that is short in nature but requires the students to pull previous information forward.\nIf the previous week’s topic was Decision Trees, I’ve shown some code and an image of DT in class that had three errors and ask the students to find and describe the errors in 10 minutes, as an example, before moving into the new session for the week."

So, keep an eye on the ideal that we are in some ways culture building/establishing best practices, which I hope gets noticed.\nPete and I will create a Team site with folders for your content and as a placeholder for documentation on the project.

You will select a popular app, like Instagram or Netflix, and do a deep dive on the systems behind it that keep it running. Then you will produce a short report detailing the goal of the app, the software needs to make it work, and the hardware required to make it so. This will focus on the business side. Imagine you are the Chief Data and Technical officer for the company and producing a report for the Chief Executive and Operations officers.\nPreparatory Assignments: READ #7-9 and Labs #7-9.\nWhy am I doing this? In the systems portion of this course, we have been studying hardware and software as well as understanding the scale involved. This assignment puts you in the position of a company that delivers a product at scale through an app. You will need to understand the goal of the company and then the necessary software and hardware to make that happen. This process of studying a company and thinking through their needs will reinforce the learning about hardware, software, and scale.\n\nLO: Identify the hardware and software components of a computer and describe their function\nLO: Describe the different scales of computer operation\n\nWhat am I going to do? First you will select a company to study, choosing from the list of Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or Netflix (if there is another you would like to do get clearance from a professor first). Once you have that chosen you will figure out what it takes to power their app. Put another way you will determine the goal, not the business goal of “make more money”, but the technical goal. For example, Netflix streams video content. Then you will research the software and hardware needs of the company to achieve that goal. Finally once you have done that research you will produce a short report detailing the various components.\nTips for success:\n\nPick an app that you use.\nTake this opportunity to learn more about something you use, be curious.\nOften apps are very different in different locations, for this assignment you can simplify and stick to the US market.\nThink about yourself and the goal of college. What software do you need to use? What hardware does that software require? Taking a few minutes to think that out can help focus you for the assignment.\n\nHow will I know I have succeeded? I will meet spec when I follow the criteria in this rubric.\n\n\n\nSpec Category\nSpec Details\n\n\n\n\nFormatting\n\nSubmit a single PDF.\n\nGive it a header stating the assignment.\n\n\n\n“Look Ahead assignment – Systems.”\nName, course, date\n\n3 page maximum, including tables and figures.\nExecutive Summary\nGoal statement\nSoftware requirements\nHardware requirements\nReferences\n\n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nGoal: A short declarative sentence or two describing the contents of the report and the major takeaways.\nList the components of the report.\nState the key figures and scale.\nHighlight any major takeaways the reader should look out for.\n\n\n\n\nGoal Statement\n\nGoal: This is a short paragraph describing the technical goal the app is trying to achieve, for example Netflix streams video.\nInclude the scale involved, how much data is stored, how much computing power is needed, etc.\nThis is not a detailed description, just a coherent statement of the mission\n\n\n\nSoftware Requirements\n\nGoal: Present a detailed description of the software used to achieve the goal.\nThis is a major section of the assignment and is about half of the length of the assignment.\nMention the major software components and their needs.\nInclude a table summarizing the software needs.\nInclude a visualization of the software needs\n\n\n\nHardware Requirements\n\nGoal: Present a detailed description of the hardware used to achieve the goal.\nThis is a major section of the assignment and is about half of the length of the assignment.\nMention the major hardware components of the system.\nInclude a table summarizing the hardware.\nInclude a visualization summarizing the hardware.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAll references should be listed at the end of the document\nUse IEEE Documentation style (link)\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements: Special thanks to Jess Taggart from UVA CTE for coaching us.

    "text": "Reading: Data and Code\nCode should be simple\nAn important principle for writing effective and intelligible code is that code should be simple — to quote Einstein, as simple as possible but no simpler.\n\nA contributing factor to code simplicity is how it is related to the data it is designed to process.\nThis relationship depends largely on how the data are structured.\nA program is always written with data in mind — what kind of data it is and how it is structured.\n\nSimplicity of code follows from the structure of data\nThere is a view among programmers which, although not orthodoxy, is commonplace.\n\nIt is the idea that the complexity of a program — its algorithms — is a function of the quality of the data structure it processes.\nIf a data structure is not well designed, algorithms may be excessively complex and hard to understand.\nHowever if a data structure is well designed, the algorithms that process them are more robust and intelligible.\n\nSupporting References\nConsider these quotes cited in an essay on Data Structures. by Igor Budasov, reproduced here:\nHere’s a quote from Linus Torvalds in 2006:\n\nI’m a huge proponent of designing your code around the data, rather than the other way around, and I think it’s one of the reasons git has been fairly successful . . . I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his [sic] code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.\n\nWhich sounds a lot like Eric Raymond’s “Rule of Representation” from 2003:\n\nFold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust.\n\nWhich was just his summary of ideas like this one from Rob Pike in 1989:\n\nData dominates. If you’ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.\n\nWhich cites Fred Brooks from 1975:\n\nRepresentation is the Essence of Programming\n\nBeyond craftsmanship lies invention, and it is here that lean, spare, fast programs are born. Almost always these are the result of strategic breakthrough rather than tactical cleverness. Sometimes the strategic breakthrough will be a new algorithm, such as the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform or the substitution of an n log n sort for an n 2 set of comparisons.\n\n\nMuch more often, strategic breakthrough will come from redoing the representation of the data or tables. This is where the heart of your program lies. Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall be continued to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts; they’ll be obvious."

Next we will illustrate for other iterables: str, tuple, set, dict\nlists, tuples, and strings are sequences. Sequences are designed so that elements come out of them in the same order they were put in.\nSets and dictionaries are not sequences, since they don’t keep elements in order. They are called collections. The ordering of the items is arbitrary.\nNOTE: This has changed for dictionaries in Python 3.7: > the insertion-order preservation nature of dict objects has been declared to be an official part of the Python language spec.\n– What’s New in Python 3.7\niterating using for\niterating using iter() and next()\niterating using for\niterating using iter() and next()\niterating using for\niterating using iter() and next()\niterating using for\nAlternatively, keys and values can be extracted from the dict by: - looping over the keys - extract the value by indexing into the dict with the key\niterating using for\nIf you just want to iterate for a known number of times, use range().\nVery often you will want to know iteration number you are on in a loop.\nThis can be used to name files or dict keys, for example.\nenumerate() will return the index and key for each iteration.\nIterations can be nested!\nThis works well with nested data structures, like dicts within dicts.\nThis is basically how JSON files are handled, BTW.\nBe careful, though – these can get deep and complicated.\niterating using iter() and next()"
