<p>What type of data is this?</p>  <p><code>Size: 227.0 cm</code></p> 
*A. <p>continuous data</p> 
B. <p>discrete data</p> 
C. <p>categorical data</p> 
D. <p>qualitative data</p> 

#FBOK:<p>227.0 is a floating point number (not discrete), so the best type of data to describe ?size? would be continuous. It isn?t categorical or qualitative.�</p>

D. <p>quantitative data</p> 
#FBOK:<p>Roles can have various types but usually would be from a given set, ?Drummer? being one of them (possibly ?Lead Vocals? being another.) So this kind of data is best described as categorical data.</p>

<p>Is the following statement true or false?</p>  <blockquote> <p>?It is better to leave data in the original, given form, because any attempt to present the same data in another way is considered dishonest.</p> </blockquote> 
True
*False
#FBOK:<p>It is perfectly fine, and in fact encouraged, to play with the data and find the best way to visualize the data so that the ideas and trends you hope to highlight are clearly communicated. �Getting creative in the way you present data is not being dishonest because you aren?t changing the values, trends, or outcomes. So this statement is false.�</p>

<p>Value can be added to data to turn the data into information by _______.�</p>  <p>(If you feel statements A, B, and C are all true, then <strong>only </strong>select option D - all of the above.)</p> 
A. <p>contextualizing the data</p> 
B. <p>finding patterns and/or associations in the data</p> 
C. <p>performing calculations on the data</p> 
*D. <p>all of the above</p> 
#FBOK:<p>Information is a level up from data, and can be obtained by adding context, finding patterns or associations, or performing calculations on the data. Therefore, the answer is D - all of the above.�</p>

<p>Which statement is true about the &quot;CDDB&quot; (CD database) example that we looked at in class?</p> 
A. <p>It is a data product because it only manufactures new information out of the data</p> 
*B. <p>It is a data product because it creates new value from the data to generate more data</p> 
C. <p>It is a data product because the data it generates (output) becomes the data that it uses to operate (input)</p> 
D. <p>It is a tool that performs look-ups to find related musical information, therefore it is a data product</p> 
#FBOK:<p><strong>Answer: B</strong> --�It is a data product because it creates new value from the data to generate more data</p>
