President and Provost's Fund for Institutionally Related Research: Data
Science Active Learning Lab.

\hypertarget{project-description}{%
\section{PROJECT DESCRIPTION}\label{project-description}}

Active learning approaches have not been widely applied and tested in
data science courses despite significant research supporting their
benefits and its successful adoption in computer science. One study
notes a 33\% increase in pass rates for computer science courses
employing active learning as compared to traditional lecture classes
\textsuperscript{{[}3{]}}. The Academy for Teaching Excellence has
thousands of resources to aid in the teaching of computer science
content with hundreds of assignments, but essentially no empirically
tested resources for data science \textsuperscript{{[}4{]}.}

A key component of the active learning approach is the design,
development, and testing of authentic and transparent assessments.
Authentic assignments asks students to either inhabit a role seen in the
discipline or do the work of the discipline. Transparent assignments
explicity state their purpose, tasks, and criteria. Research has shown
that transparent assignments improve a wide range of student success
metrics, including a sense of belonging which can be a significant
factor in the retention of underrepresented student populations,
particularly in STEM.

A major obstacle to creating authentic and transparent active learning
assessments is the time and effort required to develop, implement, and
test them. \textbf{The Data Science Active Learning Lab will provide the
resources and structure necessary for collaborative course development.}
The Lab will enable faculty and graduate students to work together to
develop and empirically test active learning activities in their data
science courses. This will result in the identification and validation
of best practices along with practical tools that can be shared broadly
and openly across the field of Data Science.

The Lab will reduce the time burden on faculty to create effective
assessments. More important, it will establish a trusted research
framework and tools that have been empirically tested for effectiveness.
Such a resource is currently unavailable in data science pedagogy. We
also have a unique opportunity, given the newness of the field, to
develop cultural norms around teaching that are known to benefit
underrepresented groups and first-generation students. This funding will
go a long way to advance that effort by establishing a pedological
research lab specifically focused on student success in a historically
fast-growing field.

\hypertarget{project-goals}{%
\section{PROJECT GOALS}\label{project-goals}}

In pursuit of the mission to provide resources to enable faculty to
create effective active learning assessments for data science, the
project has the following goals.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Be a preeminent \textbf{resource} for empirically tested best
  practices in data science education.
\item
  Establish a \textbf{testing and validation framework} for data science
  oriented active learning tools.
\item
  Create and socialize \textbf{teaching norms} in data science that are
  proven to benefit underrepresented groups and first-generation
  students.
\item
  Develop and test active learning assessments (labs) specifically for
  courses in the proposed \textbf{data science undergraduate major}.
  (Projected courses include the Foundation of Data Science, Foundations
  of Machine Learning, Computation Probability, Data Science Ethics and
  Policy, and Data Science Systems.)
\item
  \textbf{Disseminate open instructional content} in accordance with the
  School of Data Science open access policy and UVA's Open Scholarship
  agreement.
\end{itemize}

The goal of the summer is for each faculty member to create three
implementable active learning sessions that can be embedded into classes
in the next academic year. These active learning sessions should include
the following materials covering a roughly two-week period.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Roman{enumi}.}
\item
  Summary of the learning objectives for the session.
\item
  Pre-reading and/or video material.
\item
  Two Active learning lecture sessions and associated material
\item
  Assessments -- assignments, reflections, quizzes, group work etc.
\item
  Evaluation rubrics for learning outcomes.
\item
  Review process to encourage retention.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this document will describe each of these elements.

\hypertarget{materials}{%
\section{MATERIALS}\label{materials}}

\hypertarget{learning-goals}{%
\subsection{Learning Goals}\label{learning-goals}}

Learning goals should be the overarching goals of the class to which
learning objectives could then align.

Examples of Learning Goals for a Machine Learning Class might be:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Be able to describe and execute the necessary steps to prepare data
  for machine learning models.
\item
  Demonstrate understanding of the mathematical and computation machine
  requirements for several machine learning approaches and when they
  should be used.
\item
  Demonstrate understanding of effective evaluation methods given
  different machine learning approaches.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{i.-learning-objectives.}{%
\subsection{I. Learning Objectives.}\label{i.-learning-objectives.}}

Learning Session: Data Preparation 1

Learning Objectives:

1.1a) Describe the reasons for and effectively demonstrate partitioning
a dataset into train, test and tune.

2.1a) Effectively describe and demonstrate why it is necessary to
one-hot encode factor and standardize continuous variables specific to
various machine learning models.

3.1a) Execute and effectively describe dealing with missing data

II. \textbf{Pre-Reading and/or Video Material} -- This should reference
specific sections in books known to be of high quality related to the
content. I have a tendency to lean more heavily on books that include
``theory'' explanations aside from simple how-to text given that much of
the how-to will be provided in the class.

Videos can be very simple explaining the topics through presentation
materials or code at a high level. I would work to limit the length of
videos to 10 minutes or less and if several topics are covered break
them into individual video segments. As a technic to consider, I often
build a ``stop and think'' question in the video that I then discuss at
the beginning of class to encourage students to watch and engage with
the content. I also usually place these videos on YouTube as unlisted,
but this does still allow you to track the watch time.

III. \textbf{Active Learning Sessions} -- The definition of active
learning is fairly broad, but in it's simplest form it suggests that
students should not be passive in their learning. This doesn't eliminate
classical lecturing methods but augments them to include directed
moments when students are either engaging with each other or with the
professor in more robust way than a traditional Q and A session. An
example that Pete and I use a lot is ``think, pair, share''. This
includes use asking a question, having the students think on the answer
alone, then discussing with a partner and then finally sharing with the
class as a team. A good book on methods on Teaching Methods provided by
CTE is
\href{https://books.google.com/books?id=1jB_DAAAQBAJ\&printsec=frontcover\&source=gbs_ge_summary_r\&cad=0\#v=onepage\&q\&f=false}{Teaching
at its Best by Linda B. Nelson,} I've got a copy and can purchased more
if needed (also please feel free to share other references).

As a reference I found this quote from a 2021 paper focused on
developing a framework for active learning helpful: ``To clarify, we
synthesized a working definition of active learning that operates within
an elaborative framework, which we call the
\emph{construction-of-understanding ecosystem}. A cornerstone of this
framework is that undergraduate learners should be active agents during
instruction and that the social construction of meaning plays an
important role for many learners, above and beyond their individual
cognitive construction of knowledge.''

The article is available here:
\url{https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1529100620973974}

IV. \textbf{Assessments} can be the hardest and potentially the most
time-consuming portion of course materials. The traditional path in most
Data Science oriented classes is an assessment that focuses on
implementing a method in code. I would encourage you to continue this
practice but also consider adding written or verbal approaches to
evaluating learning. This might include prompts in the coding
assessments that require further written explanations or reflections on
what was the most challenging/enjoyable portion of the assignment or
what areas the students believe they need more practice. This
information can then be used in a follow-up session that highlights the
areas that a majority of students saw as needing more coverage. It is
also important to create clear expectations on how the assessment will
be evaluated and what the expectations are for the assessment. Below is
an example assessment Pete developed for the DS 1001, though not a
coding-based assessment the general structure is still relevant.

\textbf{DS 1001 -- Spring 2023 - Professors Alonzi \& Wright}

\textbf{Due Date Target: Noon, April 28; Due date final: Noon, May 10
(last day of reading days)}

\textbf{Submission format: File upload to canvas}

\textbf{Individual Assignment}

\textbf{General Description:} This assignment is all about understanding
the systems behind popular social media and content apps. You will
select a popular app, like Instagram or Netflix, and do a deep dive on
the systems behind it that keep it running. Then you will produce a
short report detailing the goal of the app, the software needs to make
it work, and the hardware required to make it so. This will focus on the
business side. Imagine you are the Chief Data and Technical officer for
the company and producing a report for the Chief Executive and
Operations officers.

Preparatory Assignments: READ \#7-9 and Labs \#7-9.

\textbf{Why am I doing this?} In the systems portion of this course, we
have been studying hardware and software as well as understanding the
scale involved. This assignment puts you in the position of a company
that delivers a product at scale through an app. You will need to
understand the goal of the company and then the necessary software and
hardware to make that happen. This process of studying a company and
thinking through their needs will reinforce the learning about hardware,
software, and scale.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  LO: Identify the hardware and software components of a computer and
  describe their function
\item
  LO: Describe the different scales of computer operation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What am I going to do?} First you will select a company to
study, choosing from the list of Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or
Netflix (if there is another you would like to do get clearance from a
professor first). Once you have that chosen you will figure out what it
takes to power their app. Put another way you will determine the goal,
not the business goal of ``make more money'', but the technical goal.
For example, Netflix streams video content. Then you will research the
software and hardware needs of the company to achieve that goal. Finally
once you have done that research you will produce a short report
detailing the various components.

\textbf{Tips for success:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Pick an app that you use.
\item
  Take this opportunity to learn more about something you use, be
  curious.
\item
  Often apps are very different in different locations, for this
  assignment you can simplify and stick to the US market.
\item
  Think about yourself and the goal of college. What software do you
  need to use? What hardware does that software require? Taking a few
  minutes to think that out can help focus you for the assignment.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{How will I know I have succeeded?} I will meet spec when I
follow the criteria in this rubric.

V. \textbf{Evaluation rubrics} for learning outcomes --

This step can likely be included in the development of assessments but
having it as a standalone emphasizes the need for thoughtful design.

The goal here should be evaluation measures tailored to the assessments
but also universal enough to be used in a standard lecture format.

Meaning that the rubrics will be included as part of the experimental
design to assess the variances in learning that occurs in an active
learning environment when compared to a lecture format.

In the above example the quality of answers to the final question, ``How
do the answers to the questions make you feel as it relates to the
presence of data driven technologies in our everyday lives?'', could be
a focus on the evaluation rubric as it relates to the specific learning
outcome around ``understanding the growing influence of data on
society''.

VI. \textbf{Review process} to encourage retention -- The idea here is
to not compartmentalize the learning objectives but blend them together
from week to week to help reinforce the topics throughout the semesters.

One method example is to have quizzes that include questions from all
weeks in the class not just the current topic. I think for this use
case, simple direct sessions that are short in nature, 10-15 minutes,
that review topics from the session makes more sense.

Examples might include a guided back and forth on the key topics from
the previous week or a team assignment that is short in nature but
requires the students to pull previous information forward.

If the previous week's topic was Decision Trees, I've shown some code
and an image of DT in class that had three errors and ask the students
to find and describe the errors in 10 minutes, as an example, before
moving into the new session for the week.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We want to publish these materials online, so when building please
  consider the goal is to make the materials publicly available.
\item
  We are also hoping to ``empirically'' test these in a classroom in the
  Spring of 24, so also be \emph{thinking} about the development of
  non-active learning materials and where best to measure results.
\item
  You've got great ideas, this is just a framework, so feel free to move
  as you see fit.
\item
  This process should be useful for future and current SDS faculty. So,
  keep an eye on the ideal that we are in some ways culture
  building/establishing best practices, which I hope gets noticed.
\item
  Pete and I will create a Team site with folders for your content and
  as a placeholder for documentation on the project. You do not need to
  use these folders, just an option.

\hypertarget{code-should-be-simple}{%
\section{Code should be simple}\label{code-should-be-simple}}

An important principle for writing effective and intelligible code is
that code should be simple --- to quote Einstein, as simple as possible
but no simpler.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A contributing factor to code simplicity is how it is related to the
  data it is designed to process.
\item
  This relationship depends largely on how the data are structured.
\item
  A program is always written with data in mind --- what kind of data it
  is and how it is structured.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{simplicity-of-code-follows-from-the-structure-of-data}{%
\section{Simplicity of code follows from the structure of
data}\label{simplicity-of-code-follows-from-the-structure-of-data}}

There is a view among programmers which, although not orthodoxy, is
commonplace.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is the idea that the complexity of a program --- its algorithms ---
  is a function of the quality of the data structure it processes.
\item
  If a data structure is not well designed, algorithms may be
  excessively complex and hard to understand.
\item
  However if a data structure is well designed, the algorithms that
  process them are more robust and intelligible.
\end{itemize}

Consider these quotes cited in an essay on
\href{https://medium.com/webdevops/data-structures-548cbea9c520}{Data
Structures}. by Igor Budasov, reproduced here:

Here's \href{https://lwn.net/Articles/193245/}{a quote from Linus
Torvalds in 2006}:

\begin{quote}
I'm a huge proponent of designing your code around the data, rather than
the other way around, and I think it's one of the reasons git has been
fairly successful . . . I will, in fact, claim that the difference
between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his
{[}sic{]} code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers
worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and
their relationships.
\end{quote}

Which sounds a lot like
\href{http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html}{Eric
Raymond's ``Rule of Representation'' from 2003}:

\begin{quote}
Fold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust.
\end{quote}

Which was just his summary of ideas like
\href{http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/pikestyle}{this one from Rob Pike
in 1989}:

\begin{quote}
Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized
things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data
structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.
\end{quote}

Which cites
\href{https://archive.org/stream/mythicalmanmonth00fred/mythicalmanmonth00fred_djvu.txt}{Fred
Brooks from 1975}:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Representation is the Essence of Programming}\\
\strut \\
Beyond craftsmanship lies invention, and it is here that lean, spare,
fast programs are born. Almost always these are the result of strategic
breakthrough rather than tactical cleverness. Sometimes the strategic
breakthrough will be a new algorithm, such as the Cooley-Tukey Fast
Fourier Transform or the substitution of an n log n sort for an n 2 set
of comparisons.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Much more often, strategic breakthrough will come from redoing
the representation of the data or tables.} This is where the heart of
your program lies. Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and
I shall be continued to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't
usually need your flowcharts; they'll be obvious.

\hypertarget{activity-hello-world}{%
\chapter{Activity: Hello, World!}\label{activity-hello-world}}

In this activity, you will run Python from the command line and become
acquainted with its most basic mode of operation.

To get started, log onto the Rivanna shell and move into in the course
directory you created for this class.

\hypertarget{which-python}{%
\section{Which Python?}\label{which-python}}

Once you are in Rivanna, you will want to know which version of Python
you have installed as the default.

To find out, from the command line type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{which}\NormalTok{ python}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This will show you the ``path'' to a python interpreter. For example:

\includegraphics{modules/M02_BasicPython/../../media/which-python.png}

If you do not see ``anaconda'' in that path, then run the following
command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ExtensionTok{module}\NormalTok{ load anaconda}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This will update your environment to use Anaconda's distribution of
Python.

After running the command, enter the command to see which pythion is
being used to confirm that it is the one from Ancaconda.

\hypertarget{aside}{%
\section{Aside}\label{aside}}

Note that you can use \texttt{module} to run other programs on your
Rivanna account.

Type \texttt{module\ list} to see which programs have already been
installed on your account.

Type \texttt{module\ spider} to see all the programs you can install.

\hypertarget{the-python-interactive-shell}{%
\section{The Python Interactive
Shell}\label{the-python-interactive-shell}}

From the command line, enter python

You should get the Python Shell:

\includegraphics{modules/M02_BasicPython/../../media/python-prompt.png}

This is also called the Python standard REPL, which stands for
``Read-Eval-Print Loop''.

Make sure you see that you are using version 3 of Python.

If you see Python 2, exit the shell by entering \texttt{quit()} and try
again by entering python3 at the command line.

At the \texttt{\textgreater{}\textgreater{}\textgreater{}} prompt type
\texttt{print("Hello,\ World!")} and press return.

If you've never used Python, you've just completed an important ritual.
If you have used Python, well, you did it again :-)

\hypertarget{try-this}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Try \texttt{this}}{Try this}}\label{try-this}}

Now, enter following line at the prompt and press return:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ this}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

What do you see?

To exit the Python Shell, enter \texttt{quit()} or \texttt{exit()} and
hit return.

\hypertarget{running-python-files}{%
\section{Running Python Files}\label{running-python-files}}

Now create a file called \texttt{hello.py} using the command line editor
\texttt{nano}. Enter the same commands you used above.

Then run it from the command line by directly invoking the Python
interpreter python.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, toprule=.15mm, opacityback=0, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, breakable, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, bottomtitle=1mm, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, arc=.35mm, bottomrule=.15mm, leftrule=.75mm]

\end{tcolorbox}

\hypertarget{activity-jupyter-lab}{%
\chapter{Activity: Jupyter Lab}\label{activity-jupyter-lab}}

Now that we have run Python on Rivanna from the command line, let's try
it using a Jupyter Notebook.

Go the OnDemand site to access Rivanna. As a reminder, the URL is
\url{https://rivanna-portal.hpc.virginia.edu/}.

From the Interactive Apps menu, select JupyterLab and fill out the form
to initiate a new session. Your form should have the following values:

\includegraphics{modules/M02_BasicPython/../../media/jupyter-on-rivanna-form.png}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, toprule=.15mm, opacityback=0, opacitybacktitle=0.6, colback=white, breakable, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Tip}, toptitle=1mm, left=2mm, titlerule=0mm, bottomtitle=1mm, rightrule=.15mm, coltitle=black, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, arc=.35mm, bottomrule=.15mm, leftrule=.75mm]

Note that you may increase the number of hours, cores, and megabytes of
RAM, but asking for too much will increase the time it takes to start
your session. So select just the resources needed and enter our course
allocation \texttt{?var:course\_allocation} if this value is different
than in the image above).

\end{tcolorbox}

Once the session is ready, launch the notebook.

Once you are in the notebook, use file system tab on the left to get to
the directory of your personal assessments repo. Remember, you created
two repos for this class --- one for course content from the instructor,
and one for your own course work. Use the latter for this exercise.

In a code cell in the notebook, enter the code to print
\texttt{"Hello,\ World!"}, and run the cell.

Save your notebook as \texttt{hello-world.ipynb}.

\hypertarget{python-data-types}{%
\chapter{Python Data Types}\label{python-data-types}}

We declare a number of variables with different value types.

By `type' we mean object type.

Data types and data structures are both types of object.

Data types are created by the way they are written or as keywords
\ldots{}

Here is a series of literal values (called \textbf{literals}):

\textbf{Integers}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{1.}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
(1, 1.0)
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Strings}

Type of quote does not matter, but they must be straight quotes, not
``smart quotes'' that some word processors use.

Note that there is no explicit \textbf{character} type as in Java and
other languages.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{"foo"} 
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\textbf{Boolean}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\VariableTok{True}\NormalTok{, }\VariableTok{False}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\hypertarget{getting-the-type-of-a-value}{%
\chapter{Getting the type of a

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{assignment}{%
\chapter{Assignment}\label{assignment}}

Data are assigned to \textbf{variables} using the assignment
\textbf{operator} \texttt{=}.

The variable is always on the \textbf{left}, the value assigned to it on
the \textbf{right}.

This is not the same as mathemtical equality.

Variables are assigned types \textbf{dynamically}.

This is in contrast to static typing, where you have define variables by
asserting what kind of data values they can hold.

Python figures out what type of data is being set to the variable and
implicitly stores that info.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{integerEx }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{8}
\NormalTok{longIntEx }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{22000000000000000000000}

\NormalTok{booleanEx }\OperatorTok{=} \VariableTok{True}
\NormalTok{noneEx }\OperatorTok{=} \VariableTok{None}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that \texttt{type()} returns the type of the value that a variable
holds, not the type ``variable''.

The identity is a number that is guaranteed to be unique and constant
for this object during its lifetime (during the program session).

You can think of it as the address of the object in memory.

\hypertarget{operators}{%
\chapter{Operators}\label{operators}}

If variables are \textbf{nouns}, and values \textbf{meanings}, then
operators are \textbf{verbs}.

In effect, they are \textbf{elementary functions} that are expressed in
sequential syntax.

\texttt{a\ +\ b} could have been expressed as \texttt{add(a,\ b)}.

Basically, \textbf{each data type is associated with a set of operators}
that allow you to manipulate the data in way that makes sense for its
type. Numeric data types are subject to mathematical operations,
booleans to logical ones, and so forth.

There are also \textbf{operations appropriate to structures}. For
example, list-like things have membership.

The relationship between types and operators is a microcosm of the
relationship betweed data structures and algorithms. \textbf{Data
structures imply algorithms and algorithms assume data structures.}

same object.

The test returns \texttt{True} if the two objects are the same object.

The test returns False if they are not the same object, even if the two
objects are 100\% equal.

Use the \texttt{==} operator to test if two variables are equal.

\hypertarget{unary-operators}{%
\chapter{Unary Operators}\label{unary-operators}}

Python offers a short-cut for most operators. When updating a variable
with an operation to that variable, such as:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_var }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ my\_var }\OperatorTok{+} \DecValTok{1}  \CommentTok{\# Incrementing}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can do this:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{my\_var }\OperatorTok{+=} \DecValTok{1}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Python supports many operators this way. Here are some:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{a }\OperatorTok{{-}=}\NormalTok{ a}
\NormalTok{a \textbackslash{}}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ a}
\NormalTok{a \textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}}\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ a}
\NormalTok{a }\OperatorTok{\%=}\NormalTok{ a}
\NormalTok{a }\OperatorTok{*=}\NormalTok{ a}
\NormalTok{a }\OperatorTok{**=}\NormalTok{ a}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{expressions}{%
\chapter{Expressions}\label{expressions}}

Variables, literal values, and operators are the building blocks of
ebxpressions.

For example, the following combines three operators and four variables:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{+} \DecValTok{2} \OperatorTok{*} \DecValTok{3} \OperatorTok{/} \DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
4.0
\end{verbatim}

Python employs \textbf{operator precedence} when evaluating expressions:

\begin{verbatim}
P – Parentheses
E – Exponentiation
M – Multiplication
D – Division
A – Addition
S – Subtraction
\end{verbatim}

You can use parentheses to group them to force the order of operations
you want:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{+} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{ (}\DecValTok{3} \OperatorTok{/} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
4.5
\end{verbatim}

Variables and literal values can be combined:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{5}
\NormalTok{m }\OperatorTok{=} \FloatTok{2.5}
\NormalTok{b }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{10}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ m }\OperatorTok{*} \DecValTok{10} \OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{ b}
\NormalTok{y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
35.0
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{y }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ m }\OperatorTok{*} \DecValTok{5} \OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{ b}
\NormalTok{y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
22.5
\end{verbatim}

Expresssion can be very complex.

Expressions evaluate to a value, just as single variables do.

Therefore, they can be put anywhere a value is accepted.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\BuiltInTok{int}\NormalTok{((y }\OperatorTok{+} \DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{**} \DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{)}

\hypertarget{nb-strings}{%

Strings are signified by quotes.

Single and double quotes are identical in function.

They must be ``straight quotes'' though -- cutting and pasting from a

Python supports special ``escape characters'' in strings that produce
effects when printed.

\begin{verbatim}
\\     Backslash (\)
\'     Single quote (')
\"     Double quote (")
\n     ASCII Linefeed, aka new line

Note that these are not unique to Python. They are part of almost all
languages.

\begin{Shaded}

a unique position that can be indexed.

Indexes are indicated by suffixed brackets, e.g.~\texttt{foo{[}{]}}

\hypertarget{nb-structures}{%
\chapter{NB: Structures}\label{nb-structures}}

In contrast to primitive data types, data structures organize types into
structures that have certain properties, such as \textbf{order},
\textbf{mutability}, and \textbf{addressing scheme}, e.g.~by index.

A list is an ordered sequence of items.

Each element of a list is associated with an integer that represents the
order in which the element appears.

Lists are indexed with \textbf{brackets} \texttt{{[}{]}}.

List elements are accessed by providing their order number in the
brackets.

Lists are \textbf{mutable}, meaning you can modify them after they have
been created.

They can contain mixed types.

\hypertarget{constructing}{%

\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{indexing-1}{%
\section{Indexing}\label{indexing-1}}

\textbf{Zero-based indexing}

Python uses xzero-based indexing, which means for a collection
\texttt{mylist}

\texttt{mylist{[}0{]}} references the first element\\
\texttt{mylist{[}1{]}} references the second element, etc

For any iterable object of length \emph{N}:\\
\texttt{mylist{[}:n{]}} will return the first \emph{n} elements from
index \emph{0} to \emph{n-1}\\
\texttt{mylist{[}-n:{]}} will return the last \emph{n} elements from
index \emph{N-n} to \emph{N-1}

A range is a sequence of integers, from \texttt{start} to \texttt{stop}
by \texttt{step}. - The \texttt{start} point is zero by default.\\
- The \texttt{step} is one by default.\\
- The \texttt{stop} point is NOT included.

Ranges can be assigned to a variable.

Very often you will want to build a dictionary from some data source,

however, requires that the key exists before you can mutate it. The
\texttt{defaultdict} type in the \texttt{collections} module solves this
problem. Here's an example.

\hypertarget{nb-structures-1}{%
\chapter{NB: Structures}\label{nb-structures-1}}

In contrast to primitive data types, data structures organize types into
structures that have certain properties, such as \textbf{order},
\textbf{mutability}, and \textbf{addressing scheme}, e.g.~by index.

A list is an ordered sequence of items.

Each element of a list is associated with an integer that represents the
order in which the element appears.

Lists are indexed with \textbf{brackets} \texttt{{[}{]}}.

List elements are accessed by providing their order number in the
brackets.

Lists are \textbf{mutable}, meaning you can modify them after they have
been created.

They can contain mixed types.

\hypertarget{constructing-3}{%

They can be \textbf{constructed} in several ways:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{indexing-2}{%
\section{Indexing}\label{indexing-2}}

\textbf{Zero-based indexing}

Python uses xzero-based indexing, which means for a collection
\texttt{mylist}

\texttt{mylist{[}0{]}} references the first element\\
\texttt{mylist{[}1{]}} references the second element, etc

For any iterable object of length \emph{N}:\\
\texttt{mylist{[}:n{]}} will return the first \emph{n} elements from
index \emph{0} to \emph{n-1}\\
\texttt{mylist{[}-n:{]}} will return the last \emph{n} elements from
index \emph{N-n} to \emph{N-1}

\hypertarget{sets-1}{%
\chapter{Sets}\label{sets-1}}

A \texttt{set} is an unordered collection of unique objects.

They are subject to set operations.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{peanuts }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ \{}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}snoopy\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}snoopy\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}woodstock\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{peanuts}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note the set is deduped

Since sets are unordered, they don't have an index. This will break:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{peanuts[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ peanut }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ peanuts:}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(peanut)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Check if a value is in the set using \texttt{in}}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\textquotesingle{}snoopy\textquotesingle{}} \KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ peanuts}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Combine two sets

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{set1 }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ \{}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}python\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}R\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{\}}
\NormalTok{set2 }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ \{}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}R\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}SQL\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This fails:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{set1 }\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{ set2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This succeeds:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{set1.union(set2)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Get the set intersection

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{set1.intersection(set2)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{ranges-1}{%
\chapter{Ranges}\label{ranges-1}}

A range is a sequence of integers, from \texttt{start} to \texttt{stop}
by \texttt{step}. - The \texttt{start} point is zero by default.\\
- The \texttt{step} is one by default.\\
- The \texttt{stop} point is NOT included.

Ranges can be assigned to a variable.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{rng }\OperatorTok{=} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

More often, ranges are used in iterations, which we will cover later.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{for}\NormalTok{ rn }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ rng:}
    \BuiltInTok{print}\NormalTok{(rn)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{rangy }\OperatorTok{=} \BuiltInTok{range}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{11}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}

\hypertarget{collections-and-defaultdict-1}{%
\chapter{\texorpdfstring{Collections and
\texttt{defaultdict}}{Collections and defaultdict}}\label{collections-and-defaultdict-1}}

Very often you will want to build a dictionary from some data source,
and add keys as they appear. The default \texttt{dict} type in Python,
however, requires that the key exists before you can mutate it. The
\texttt{defaultdict} type in the \texttt{collections} module solves this
problem. Here's an example.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{source\_data }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{"""}
\StringTok{Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. }
\StringTok{Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\textquotesingle{}s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, }
\StringTok{when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type }
\StringTok{specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap }
\StringTok{into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was }
\StringTok{popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing }
\StringTok{Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software }
\StringTok{like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.}
